response = "Colonel Tenders stretches his wings, sore after a day's hard work. Old memories start flooding back, reminding him of the brutalities of war, with flashbacks of his comrades savagely disintergrated under the cries of falling artillery.
Colonel Tenders goes to the bar for a drink, and saw Ham Solo at the counter as usual. \"How do you cope the horrors of war, Solo?\" asked Colonel Tenders.
\"When confronted with an enemy, I always shoot first - better alive than dead, I'd say!\" replied Ham Solo. 
Colonel Tenders felt much better after that."
