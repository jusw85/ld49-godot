response = "Mrs Bacon was enjoying the mud bath under the hot sun, when Billy Goat saw her. \"What are you looking at, old man\", asked Mrs Bacon. Billy Goat, unhappily said to her, \"Everyone is contributing since the horses left, yet I have not seen a pig doing anything productive.\"
Insulted, Mrs Bacon mocked Billy, \"Who do you think you are! Do you know who I am? You work for me; I don't work for you.\"
Enraged, Billy charged towards Mrs Bacon, and the momentum of his headbutt launched Mrs Bacon into the tree, snapping it into two.
Cluck Norris is pleased with what he saw."
