\"Hi Harry, I was wondering if you are feeling better after the nasty fall,\" asked Ms Teriyaki.
\"Well, that was nothing much, as I was aiming the haystack anyway,\" Harry replied, \"By the way, would you like a drink if you are thirsty?\" asked Harry.
\"I would love to! I know a nice place serving japanese tea nearby,\" suggested Ms Teriyaki excited.
\"Oh, no way I would pay for overpriced tea. I meant to offer you this lov.. I mean, 'health potion' that i just brewed. Would you like to drink it?\"
Ms Teriyaki accepts his health potion.
\"Just according to Keikaku\", thought Harry"
