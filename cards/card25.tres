text = "Billy Goat eats a mushroom"
response = "Billy Goat was tasked by his wife Nanny to climb the hills and look for mushrooms for dinner.
As he was not a mushroom expert, he went ask Ham Solo for advice. 
\"So you are looking for mushrooms, old Billy?\" asked Ham Solo, \"why don't you buy some of my mushrooms instead? I will let you have some for a good price!\"
Relieved, Billy Goat traded with Ham Solo, not knowing he just bought psychedelic mushrooms. Billy consumed one of the mushrooms and had a spiritual awakening."
