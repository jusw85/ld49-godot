text = "Ham Solo goes to a bar"
response = "Ham Solo has a few drinks with his buddy Mr Goatse, when they saw Chef Ramsey flirting with Ms Teriyaki, and wrote down something on a piece of paper in haste.
\"Do you think, Goatse, that chick just gave Ramsey her number?\" queried Ham Solo.
\"If he wrote down her number, then let's steal it!\" suggested Mr Goatse.
While Ramsey was not looking, Ham Solo and Mr Goatse sneaked into the kitchen and stole the paper. It wasn't Ms Teriyaki's number as they thought, but a recipe containing 11 herbs and spices.
\"Why not we give Colonel Tenders this recipe. Perhaps it could inspire him to barbeque again and forget his past?\" suggested Ham Solo.
Mr Goatse thought it was a good idea to give Colonel Tenders this recipe to cheer him up. \"I will share with him some meat too, hoping he would barbeque some food for everyone!\" said Mr Goatse."
