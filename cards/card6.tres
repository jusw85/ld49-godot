response = "Colonel Tenders was staring into the distance, when his neighbour Mr Goatse called out to him. \"Hey Sir, would you like to have some meat?\" asked Mr Goatse. 
Colonel Tenders, who used to be a chef, replied \"Well, I'm an expert on grilled meat.\" 
Colonel Tenders started grilling the meat, and before long, the aroma of barbequed meat permeated every corner of the farm. 
The pigs were salivating as they quickly arrived to get a taste of Colonel Tenders' special BBQ meat. 
The pigs quickly gorged on grilled meat, without knowing what they were eating. 
Ramsey and Goatse were watching."
