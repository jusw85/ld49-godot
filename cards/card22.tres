response = "Dismayed by the food crumbs left on the floor by the other pigs, Harry Porker went searching for a broom to clean up the mess. 
He found an old broom on the hay cart outside the barn door. Harry Porker picked up the broom and grabbed it between his thighs, as he slipped on his gloves. 
Wiggly Pig who was nearby, saw him and hollered, \"Yer a wizard, Harry!\"
With this relevation, Harry thought to himself, perhaps he should use magic and fly away on this broom from this miserable hell hole! 
He climbed to the loft of the barn and positioned himself. With both hands grasping the shaft, he leapt off the loft window - only to crash into the hay cart below."
