response = "Ham Solo was watering the plants, when he saw old Billy Goat chasing after little Wiggly Pig, who was clearly upset and in tears. Ham solo knew what Billy did to Mrs Bacon, and assumed that Wiggly was under attack as well. 
Ham Solo decided to take matters into his own hands, recalling what he said to Colonel Tenders earlier. 
Ham solo draws his revolver from the holster and took aim at Billy Goat, ready to fire. 
* * BANG * *
Out of nowhere, Ramsey appears and wrestled him to the ground, but the shot had already rung out, triggering Colonel Tender's PTSD."
