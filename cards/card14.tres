response = "Mrs Bacon had trouble singing the high notes as usual, feeling that her throat has been sore.
\"If only there is something to drink that could soothe my throat,\" muttered Mrs Bacon.
Ms Teriyaki who had just left Harry Porker's house, was holding on to the health potion given to her. 
\"I happened to overhear you, Mrs Bacon. Would you like to drink this health potion brewed by Harry Porker?\" asked Ms Teriyaki.
\"That will be perfect!,\" thanked Mrs Bacon as she gulped down the drink. 
The love potion started to take effect, making her fall in love with the first man she saw.
At this moment, a dazed and confused Billy Goat came by, and as they locked eyes, all the hatred they had for each other was momentarily gone."
