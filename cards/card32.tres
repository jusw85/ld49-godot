\"I didn't understand anything Professor Albert said,\" Billy Goat replied, \"all I remembered from the meeting was that manure is a viable source of energy.\"
Mr Goatse thought that was what intellectuals did, and went to the manure pile and started eating it... only to develop a tummy ache. Mr Goatse rushed to the outhouse."
