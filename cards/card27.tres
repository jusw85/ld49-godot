When Nanny was away, Billy dug out his old basketball and practised shooting hoops in the back yard. 
Wiggly Pig was walking by when she saw Billy playing basketball alone. \"Can I join your game, Mr Billy Goat?\" asked Wiggly Pig.
\"We don't play with lazy pigs like you,\" said Billy.
Wiggly was upset, and went home to complain to her mother, Mrs Bacon."
