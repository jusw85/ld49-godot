response = "Old Billy Goat doesn't like to hear his wife, Nanny, nagging at him to do his chores all day. When Nanny is away, Billy retrieves his old ball from his store and practised shooting hoops at his back yard. Wiggly Pig  was walking by when she saw Billy playing basketball alone. \"Can I join your game, Mr Billy Goat?\" asked Wiggly Pig.
\"We don't play with lazy pigs like you,\" said Billy. Wiggly is upset, and went home to complain to her mother, Mrs Bacon."
